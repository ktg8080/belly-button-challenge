Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

Overview

This project involves building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The goal is to create visualizations that allow users to dynamically explore data for different samples, focusing on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in individuals.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (OTUs) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Features

The dashboard provides the following features:

	1.	Interactive Bar Chart: Displays the top 10 OTUs found in an individual with a dropdown menu to select a specific sample.
	2.	Bubble Chart: Visualizes all OTUs for a selected sample, displaying their abundance and variety.
	3.	Demographic Panel: Shows metadata for the selected sample, such as demographic information.
	4.	Dynamic Updates: All charts and the demographic panel update whenever a new sample is selected from the dropdown.



Bar Chart

	•	A horizontal bar chart that shows the top 10 OTUs for each individual.

Bubble Chart

	•	A bubble chart that visualizes the bacterial cultures found in the sample, with markers sized by sample values and colored by OTU IDs.

Demographic Info Panel

	•	A panel that shows the demographic information of the selected individual.
